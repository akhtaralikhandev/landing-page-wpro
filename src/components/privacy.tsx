        <strong>Information We Collect</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily
        provided” information and “automatically collected” information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you
        knowingly and actively provide us when using or participating in any of
        our services and promotions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “Automatically collected” information refers to any information
        automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing our
        products and services.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Log Data</strong>

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, if you encounter certain errors while using the site, we
        may automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances
        surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details
        about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened,
        and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may
        not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that
        they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Please be aware that while this information may not be personally
        identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data
        to personally identify individual persons.

        <strong>Security of Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain

        <br />
        <br />
        Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you
        provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or
        storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security
        strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the

        We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This

        that identify you.
        <br />

        <strong>Do Not Track</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites
        that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this
        time, we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We adhere to the standards outlined in this privacy policy, ensuring we
        collect and process personal information lawfully, fairly,
        transparently, and with legitimate, legal reasons for doing so.

        terms that describe clearly the nature of such an offer. Participation
