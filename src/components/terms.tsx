        owned by or licensed to ChicLu and are protected by applicable copyright
        and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download one copy of
        the materials for personal, non-commercial transitory use.
        <br />
        <br />
        This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This
        license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
        restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by ChicLu at
        any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>User-Generated Content</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over content you
        submit to us for publication on our website. We will never claim
        ownership of your content, but we do require a license from you in order
        to use it.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you use our website or its associated services to post, upload,
        share, or otherwise transmit content covered by intellectual property
        rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
        sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, distribute, modify, run, copy,
        publicly display, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of
        your content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy
        preferences and our Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting your
        content or account. However, to the extent that we (or our partners)
        have used your content in connection with commercial or sponsored
        content, the license will continue until the relevant commercial or post
        has been discontinued by us.
        <br />
        <br />
        You give us permission to use your username and other identifying
        information associated with your account in a manner that is consistent
        with your privacy preferences, and our Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Liability</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an as is
        basis. To the extent permitted by law, ChicLu makes no warranties,
        expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
        warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
        conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.
        <br />
        <br />
        In no event shall ChicLu or its suppliers be liable for any
        consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
        arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials
        on this website, even if ChicLu or an authorized representative has been
        notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any
        consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit,
        loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill,
        loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use
        and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract,
        equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
        warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void or
        unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void or unenforceable.
